      <h1>Childhood moments</h1>
      <p>One of my most cherished childhood memories is rooted in the qualities that shaped who I am today—resilience, curiosity, and the joy of creation.
         I remember how challenges never discouraged me; instead, they became opportunities to learn and grow. 
         My curiosity pushed me to explore, to ask questions, and to see the world not just as it was, but as it could be.

        <h3>Early curiosity</h3>
       <p>What brought me the greatest joy was the act of building things from scratch.
         Whether it was piecing together small projects, experimenting with ideas, or simply creating something new with my own hands, 
         I found fulfillment in the process of turning imagination into reality. That sense of wonder and determination has stayed with me, reminding me that
         every obstacle can be overcome and every idea has the potential to become something meaningful.</p>

        <p>From family gatherings to neighborhood projects, I learned collaboration and responsibility.</p>

        <h3>First codes</h3>
        <p>I wrote my first lines of code on a shared computer lab machine—patience became a superpower.</p>
